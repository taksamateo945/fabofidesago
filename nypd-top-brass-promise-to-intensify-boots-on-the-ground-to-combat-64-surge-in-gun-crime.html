mission to crack down on fraudulent license plates if there are no shootings this summer.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Some may look at that and say that’s unrealistic, but I assure you that in this agency – from every cop on the street to civilian members to myself and everyone in between – day and night, all through the day, thinks about how to keep people safe,’ he said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Harrison said that fake plates have been connected to 33 shootings and 60 other incidents where shots were fired. ‘Just this week we had a shooting in Southeast Queens where the individuals were in a car with a fraudulent plate,’ Shea added.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Harrison called the increase in fake plates a ‘by-product’ of pandemic lockdowns because criminals could exploit the fact that the Department of Motor Vehicles was inundated with guests and operating under limited hours.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>To approach this, the NYPD plans to scan online marketplaces to spot fake plates and cops have been trained to tell the differences between real license plates.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Mayor de Blasio called the reasons for the uptick in crimes ‘a perfect storm of negative factors’ that is playing out in cities across the country.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘We will turn it around,’ he said. ‘I think it is a mistake to say here is our exact metrical pattern.

the economy is coming back.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I’m very confident about where we’re going, but I still think it’s gonna take time to know exactly how it’s gonna play out.’</p><img
