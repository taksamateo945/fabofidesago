It’s almost as if you’re giving the new generation with a contemplative message, telling them that they can accomplish anything at any time and that all they have to do is be human and breathe. The film, directed by Nancy Meyers, introduces a whole new set of principles and norms for working, living, and being human. If you enjoy it as much as I do, I am confident that the films on this list will not disappoint you. We attempted to compile a list of films that are similar to The Intern and that we suggest.

In this film, various forms of single lives are explored. Alice (Dakota Johnson) falls for one man after another, while her friend/coworker Robin (Rebel Wilson) is a wild partying one night stand person, while Alice’s sister, an OB/GYN, refuses to fall for any men or babies, and Lucy (Alison Brie), who still believes in the Cinderella story, waits for her right man. When people start coming in, their entire lives become a roller coaster. “Why do we always have to tell our experiences through relationships, why can’t we start with I am single?” argues the film. It’s a must-see if you want to laugh out loud and simply enjoy and chill with your buddies, especially if you’re a girl.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u94f442099f09db8669b257e588b30824><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Movies Like Fried Green Tomatoes: A Cinematic Feast of Similar Stories</span></a><h2>ALSO READ : <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">37 Psychological Thrillers On Netflix That Will Leave You Surprised</a></h2><h3><span id=Its_Kind_of_a_Funny_Story>It’s Kind of a Funny Story</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/It’s-Kind-of-a-Funny-Story.jpg alt width=825 height=464 sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>The film, which is based on Ned Vizzini’s novel of the same name, examines the serious and critical issue of suicide and psychiatric difficulties in a lighthearted and humorous manner.
