It is an online streaming prayer Ministry organized by Pastor Jerry Eze, the founder of the Streams Of Joy International church. According to the pastor, the NSPPD platform was not a premeditated idea from the establishment of his ministry. It rather emanated from the 2020 Covid-19 government restrictions on worship centers across Nigeria.</p><p>Due to the situation which affected all churches, he got furious about the fact that the devil was trying to triumph over Christians by restricting them from going to worship God. That was when Pastor Jerry Eze decided to take his ministry online. His intention was to get the gospel to every nook and crannies despite the restrictions. And that was how NSPPD online prayer stream came to life.</p><p>With tons of views recorded when it was launched, the pastor then decided to intensify his efforts and the prayer ministry continued growing.
